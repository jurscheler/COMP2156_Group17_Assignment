Ahmed Salah - I created and update my txt files using nano and visual studio code. I also merged the main branch in to my student id branch and vice versa for COMP 2156. I had to create the Student-ID-Name branch using gitbash. The assignment also required to do 10 commits in total for all 3 txt files.
